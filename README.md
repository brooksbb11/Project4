## Background (What?)
Lead poisoning can cause irreversible neurological damage in children. Lead in drinking water or paint are typical sources of lead poisoning. Currently, public health focuses response after children test for elevated lead levels. But we may be able to get ahead of the curve by using machine learning models. More information on childhood lead poisoning prevention can be found at the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/lead/overview.html). 

## Motivation (Why?)
We are motivated to address lead poisoning prevention as we all are impacted indirectly by lead issues. Dakota has children, Brittany is an educator, and we all care about preventing poisoning in our communities. 

## Timeframe (When?)
The data is limited to 2020.

## Modeling (How?)
We used NYS data on blood lead levels and school water quality. We coupled the data with the Social Vulnerability Index data from CDC, which includes demographics and housing data. The machine learning models predicted childhood lead exposure by using the aforementioned data.

# Visuals
We created a [Tableau Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/NYChildhoodLeadPoisonining/DashboardBlood?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) to provide a space for New York parents/caretakers/guardians to look at the data from 2020. They can hopefully inform themselves of the risk and prevent lead poisoning among their children.

Here is a snapshot of the dashboard:

In addition, we have a Google slide deck prepared. [Google Presentation][(https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1bt47caeji-csvwctJ8ict2xzWcgtx2SBKmR-Ozlxb54/edit?usp=sharing)]
